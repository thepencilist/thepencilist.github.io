                    I loved Lego as a kid, and I still like building things. I believe a blank sheet of paper is a challenge to be accepted.
                    I enjoy confronting a software-design problem: working out a solution and implementing it. Presented
                    with the big picture, I try to find a way to make my work fit in harmoniously. I like to write code.
                    Getting the details right matters. I’m not dogmatic: Building something that works as needed is more
                    important than a specific technology or tool. It’s been more than ten years, and I still enjoy building
                    with code.

            <h1>Software Architect / Software Project Lead / Senior Software Developer</h1>
            <h2>Kodak Alaris (September 2005 - present)</h2>
            <p>
                Designed and implemented an HTML5 single-page application that creates and fulfills photo products using Kodak Alaris REST
                services. To create the best customer experience emphasis was placed on: fast UI updates, minimizing network
                requests, and optimizing resource downloads. To achieve these goals a variety of client-side toolkits and
                components are used including: React, Redux, React-Intl, WebWorkers, and ServiceWorker. These were supplemented
                at build time using Node.js and Gulp to automate the compression of resources, such as PNG images, and concatenation
                and minification of Javascript and SASS files. Source code is managed by Github and organized in modules
                which are transpiled to browser compatible ES5 Javascript using Webpack. The application deploys automatically
                from GitHub to an Azure server when code is committed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Architected and implemented the Kiosk Web Apps API and Javascript SDK which allows 3rd party partners to implement Web-based
                embedded applications with controlled access to the kiosk’s environment and devices. This API allows new
                products and services to be added to the kiosk without requiring code changes by Kodak Alaris. Development
                involved designing the API, implementing the kiosk components that display and interact with the Web app,
                writing developer documentation to be shared with partners, creating test tools for partner developers (including
                IIS served ASP.Net Web pages and REST service examples), and providing technical support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designed and implemented the components that allow the Kodak Picture Kiosk to interact with Facebook, Instagram, and other
                services, allowing customers to make photo products from their images. The architecture reduces the time
                to add new photo services from weeks to days or hours. The data-driven design based on XSLT and loosely coupled
                late-binding interfaces reduces the time and effort needed to update the kiosk when Internet services modify
                their API.

            <p>
                Worked with the project’s Commercialization Manager to schedule and plan the project’s quality activities for both software
                and hardware. Supervised activities of test engineers and technicians. Reviewed software test plans for quality
                metrics and procedures. Worked with the software lead to finalize the processes for incident reports and
                change requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a quality engineer, designed and documented software functionality test procedures based on requirements. Compiled test
                results for presentation during gate reviews. Designed and documented hardware quality plans for EMC compliance,
                environmental testing, robustness and reliability, and shipping and packaging requirements.
